# Divorce_Prediction
Predicting which couple is likely to be divorced using the KNN and Neural Network Algorithm

Divorce is a difficult and painful process, and it happens all round the world. 
As at 2021, the average divorce rate in the UK is 42percent and in also in 2020 same percentage 
of married couple got divorced with 103592 couples and a decrease of 4% compared to 2019
(SpiderGroup & SpiderGroup, 2022)
   This project predicts divorce from series of data given to us from the he divorce predictorâ€™s dataset which 
originates from turkey and can be found in the UCI machine learning repository (UCI Machine 
Learning Repository: Divorce Predictors Data Set Data Set, n.d.).
It is based on these 54 questions asked to one hundred and seventy (170 ) participant which are either divorce or happily 
married and with a percentage of divorced to Happily married as 49% ( 94) to 51%(86). The 
questions are graded on a 5-point scale from 0 to 4 with 4 been the best and 0 the worst case.
The last category which is the 54th attributes indicate the class column which represents 1 for 
when the couples are divorced and 0 indicating not divorced.
The K Nearest Neighbors and the Artificial Neural Network are the twoclassification models used for predictions.
