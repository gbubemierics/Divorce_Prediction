My First Experience with Data Science: Predicting Divorce Using Machine Learning

💔 Can machine learning predict divorce? In this project, I explored how relationship dynamics can be analysed using data science to classify whether
couples are likely to stay married or get divorced. This was my first hands-on data science project, where I applied exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
feature selection and machine learning models to uncover patterns in relationship data.


🔍 Key Highlights
✅ Dataset: Relationship questionnaire responses from 170 couples, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
✅ EDA: Analyzed class distribution, feature correlations, and relationship trends
✅ Feature Selection: Used Random Forest & Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to optimize model performance
✅ Machine Learning Models: Compared K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Neural Networks (MLPClassifier)
✅ Results: Neural Network outperformed KNN with 99% accuracy in predicting divorce likelihood


📂 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Importing & preprocessing the dataset
2️⃣ Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
3️⃣ Selecting the most important features
4️⃣ Splitting the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
5️⃣ Training and evaluating KNN and Neural Network models
6️⃣ Fine-tuning models with hyperparameter optimization


🚀 Lessons & Future Improvements
🔹 Deeper EDA: More visualizations (pair plots, box plots) for deeper insights
🔹 Baseline Model Comparison: A simple logistic regression model for benchmarking
🔹 Explainability Techniques: Using SHAP values to interpret model predictions
🔹 Optimizing Neural Network: Experimenting with different architectures & activation functions
