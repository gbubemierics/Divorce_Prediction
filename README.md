<h1><b>My First Experience with Data Science: Predicting Divorce Using Machine Learning</b></h1>

💔 Can machine learning predict divorce? <br>In this project, I explored how relationship dynamics can be analyzed using data science to classify whether couples are likely to stay married or get divorced. This was my first hands-on data science project, where I applied exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and machine learning models to uncover patterns in relationship data.
<br>

🔍 Key Highlights<br>
✅ Dataset: Relationship questionnaire responses from 170 couples, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository<br>
✅ EDA: Analyzed class distribution, feature correlations, and relationship trends<br>
✅ Feature Selection: Used Random Forest & Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to optimize model performance<br>
✅ Machine Learning Models: Compared K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Neural Networks (MLPClassifier)<br>
✅ Results: Neural Network outperformed KNN with 99% accuracy in predicting divorce likelihood<br>

📂 Project Workflow<br>
1️⃣ Importing & preprocessing the dataset<br>
2️⃣ Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations<br>
3️⃣ Selecting the most important features<br>
4️⃣ Splitting the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets<br>
5️⃣ Training and evaluating KNN and Neural Network models<br>
6️⃣ Fine-tuning models with hyperparameter optimization<br>
<br>

🚀 Lessons & Future Improvements<br>
🔹 Deeper EDA: More visualizations (pair plots, box plots) for deeper insights<br>
🔹 Baseline Model Comparison: A simple logistic regression model for benchmarking<br>
🔹 Explainability Techniques: Using SHAP values to interpret model predictions<br>
🔹 Optimizing Neural Network: Experimenting with different architectures & activation functions<br>
